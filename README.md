# HR-Analytics-PowerBI

HR analytics aim to provide insight into how best to manage employees and reach business goals. The objective is to monitor key HR metrics on employees and identify what factors impact attrition. The analysis is performed using an HR dataset for a company.

Created several reports with information on the following factors which will help the company determine what are the reasons for employee attrition.

Overview- Job Role, Job Level, Monthly Salary, Salary Hike, attrition rate, etc.

Demographics- age, gender, ethnicity, seniority, etc.

Attrition- attrition rate on the basis of tenure, overtime requirement, job role, etc.

Tools: Python, Excel, Power BI
